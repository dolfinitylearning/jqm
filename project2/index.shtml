      <h1>Project 2</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
      You can do this project alone, or with one other human in the class. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Write a Web app that tracks ticket sales at a zoo. Tickets for 
      adults cost $10 each. Tickets for kids cost $6 each. 
    </p>
    <p>  
      Client-side only. Use jQuery. Use store.js to persist the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      After adding some data, the app might look like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="screen1.png" class="img-responsive local-bordered" alt="Output">
    </p>
    <p>
      The delete button deletes an entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The New button adds a new entry. Assume that the user does not make
      any mistakes.
      You can just use <code>prompt()</code>, if you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="prompt.png" class="img-responsive local-bordered" alt="Prompt">
    </p>
    <p>
      New entries don't have to appear in the right order, sorted by day.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you add or remove an entry, the stats update automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add appropriate comments, as in the samples on this site.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the top of the page, show the name(s) of the human(s) who 
      did the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do the basics described so far, you will get 15 out of 20. 
      For extra points:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When new data is added, show it in day order.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the user clicks New, show a form at the bottom of the page,
        instead of using <code>prompt()</code>. Hide the form after the data is entered.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add input validation. Numeric data only, no values less than zero.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add an edit button to each entry. When the user clicks it, replace
        the data values with form fields. Hide the Delete and Edit
        buttons, and show Save and Cancel buttons instead. (2 points)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Submit the URL of your page in Moodle. List the extra things you did, 
      if any. Type the name(s) of the human(s) who did the project.
