      You may be asking yourself:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Self, how was this site made?
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      OK, you aren't, but here it is, anyway.

    <h2>HTML/CSS framework</h2>
    
    <p>
      It's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. Why Bootstrap? 
      Two reasons.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It looks good. I <em>suck</em> at design. Better to let 
      Bootstrap handle it.</li>
      <li>It's responsive. Try it. Resize your browser window,
      try it on a phone, whatevs. It works, without my having to do
      very much.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Bootstrap takes some learning, but it's worth it. I don't know
      what the best Bootstrap resources are. Ideas?
    </p>
    
    <h2>Server-side includes</h2>
    
    <p>I wanted to have a bunch of pages. They should all look the same,
    have the same navbar, etc. </p>
    
    <p>That navbar should be easy to change. If I want to add a new 
    link, I'd like to be able to change one file, and have all the pages
    on the site change. How to do that?</p>
    
    <p>An easy way is to use server-side includes. Needs no programming. </p>
    
    <p>Look at this page's URL. The extension is <code>.shtml</code>, not 
      <code>.html</code>. When Apache gets a URL ending in <code>.shtml</code>,
      it looks for special commands in the content. It executes the commands,
      then sends the result to your browser.</p>
    
    <p>
      The commands are written as HTML comments. Here's an HTML comment:
    </p>
    
    <pre>&lt;!-- Hello! I'm a comment. --&gt;</pre>
    
    <p>
      HTML comments don't show up on the page. People who write HTML
      use comments to make notes to themselves. Here's an example:
    </p>
    
    <!-- Remember to talk about server-side includes. -->
    
    <p>
      See that comment? Well, of course not, it doesn't show up. It's in the
      source, though. Ctrl+U will show it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Back to server-side includes (SSI). I made a directory (folder) called
      <code>includes</code>. Then I took the HTML that makes the
      navbar, and put it the file <code>navbar.html</code> in that 
      directory. Here are the files on the site so far:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <img src="files.png" alt="Files" class="img-responsive" >
    </p>
    <p>  
      I can include the navbar HTML in any <code>.shtml</code>
      page by typing:
    </p>
    
    <pre>&lt;!--#include virtual="includes/navbar.html" --&gt;</pre>
    
    <p>
      Apache replaces the directive with the contents of the file.
    </p>
    
    <p>Here's the template I made for every page on this site:</p>
    
    <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;!--#include virtual=&quot;includes/head.html&quot; --&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;!--#include virtual=&quot;includes/navbar.html&quot; --&gt;
    &lt;!--#include virtual=&quot;includes/body-start.html&quot; --&gt;
    &lt;div class="page-header"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Content&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;!--#include virtual=&quot;includes/body-end.html&quot; --&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
    
    <p>
      To make a new page, I copy the template, and add markup. If I want to 
      change the navbar, I change the file <code>navbar.html</code>,
      and every page on the site changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      SSI is a (relatively) old technology, useful for simple sites
      like this. It has problems. For example, I use root relative
      or absolute links in the included files, rather than relative links.
      (CoreDogs explains the difference.) This makes files harder to
      move around within and between sites.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Another problem is highlighting the current page in the 
      menu. That is, if you look at the home page, the Home link
      in the menu is highlighted. If you look at this page,
      its menu link, and its parent, are highlighted.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Normally, you do that by adding the class <code>active</code> to
      the current page's link in the navbar HTML, like this:</p>
    
    <pre>&lt;li class="active"&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/this-site.shtml&quot;&gt;This site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</pre>
    
    <p>
      That makes the navbar
      code slightly different for each page. It won't work with SSI,
      since we need the navbar code to be <em>exactly</em> the same 
      for each page.
    </p>
    
    <p>The solution was to use
      <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11533542/twitter-bootstrap-add-active-class-to-li"
         target="_blank">JavaScript code from Stack Overflow</a>. Stack Overflow
      is the go-to place for coding questions. 
    </p>
      
    <p>      
      For larger projects, I use my fave CMS 
      <a href="https://drupal.org" target="_blank">Drupal</a>.
