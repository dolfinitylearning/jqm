      <h1>Project 4</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
      You can do your own project, or this one. 
      You can do this project alone, or with one other human in the class. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Write an app called OU Places. As you wander around campus, it shows 
      you where you are, and tells you about that place. If it doesn't know
      about the place, it just shows you a map with your location:
    </p>
    <p>  
      <img src="screen1.png" class="img-responsive local-bordered" alt="Output">
    </p>
    <p>
      If the app knows where you are, it tells you something about that location.
      For example:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="rec.png" class="img-responsive local-bordered" alt="Rec center">
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="eh.png" class="img-responsive local-bordered" alt="Elliott Hall">
    </p>
    <p>
      I need a way to test your app. When the user clicks on the text in the
      footer, the app asks the user for lat/long, rather than getting it 
      from the phone:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="test.png" class="img-responsive local-bordered" alt="Testing">
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>It's important that I can test your app by typing in lat and 
      long for a known point. If I can't, I won't assume that your
      code works.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Add at least four locations to your app. Make sure that the Rec Center and
      Elliott Hall are among them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Add appropriate comments in your code, as in the samples on this site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Submit your URL in Moodle, with the name(s) of the human(s) who 
      did the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do the basics described so far, you will get 25 out of 30. 
      For extra points:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add an opening screen, giving the name of the app, and the people
        who wrote it. With some images. And a start button, or some such. (1 point)
      </li>
      <li>
        Make it look cool, with brighter colors. Try the theme roller at the
        jQM site, or liberate an already-made theme. 
        (2 points)
      </li>
      <li>
        Add ads on each screen. Randomly choose ads from a collection (maybe an 
        <code>Ad</code> object type?) Make whatever ads you want. 
        Funny ads are good. (2 points)
      </li>
      <li>
        Have the app speak the name of each location. (2 points)
      </li>
      <li>
        Other cool things.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Hints:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href='t1.html' target="_blank">This page</a> shows a sample of the
        Google geolocation API in action. It shows you how to get a phone's
        current location, in lat/long.
        Stealing is good. Also check <a 
          href='https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/map-geolocation'
          target="_blank">this</a>. Alos, there are 4.2 bazillion other 
          JavaScript geolocation tutorials on
          the InterWebs. 
      </li>
      <li>You can use a timer to update the map, and show appropriate content
        about the current location. Every 10 secs is OK. 
        This code will run the function <code>controller</code> after 
        <code>timerInvervalMsecs</code> milliseconds:
        <pre>timeoutId = window.setTimeout(controller, timerInvervalMsecs);</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        This code will clear a timer. Use it to stop the timer when the user is
        testing the app, so the user can type in lat/long without being interrupted:
        <pre>window.clearTimeout( timeoutId );</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        I used a zoom of 18 for the map options.
      </li>
      <li>
        How to test whether the phone is in a known location? I created 
        an object type called <code>Location</code>, holding data about one 
        known location (EH, Rec Center, etc.). Each <code>Location</code> 
        defines a rectangle for the location.
        If the phone is in that rectangle, show content about the location. 
        I gave <code>Location</code> five properties:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Lat and long of the northwest corner of the location.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lat and long of the southeast corner of the location.
          </li>
          <li>
            Content describing the location.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        I created an array called <code>locations</code> that contained
        <code>Location</code> objects. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Here's the basic logic. When the timer goes off, show the 
        current location, then use a ForEach to loop through 
        <code>locations</code>. If the phone is in one of them, show the
        location's details. Start the timer again.
      </li>
        
    </ul>

      Submit the URL of your page in Moodle. List the extra things you did, 
      if any. Type the name(s) of the human(s) who did the project.
