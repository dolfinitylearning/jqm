      <h1>Data models exercises</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead" id="exer1">Cars 1</p>
    <p>Create a Car class, with whatever attributes you like, but make one of the 
      attributes <code>weight</code>. Give the class a 
      <code>render()</code> function. Make a page that shows data about
      five cars. Base it on the <a href="/storing-data-notes/dogs/t1.html">first dog class</a>.</p>
    
    
    <p class="lead" id="exer2">Cars 2</p>
    <p>Use an array for your cars, as in the 
      <a href="/storing-data-notes/dogs/t2.html">second dog example</a>. Write code
      that shows all of the car data.</p>
    <p>
      Show the total weight of all the cars. Write code that works no matter
      how many cars are in the array.
    </p>
    
    
    <p class="lead" id="exer3">Cars 3</p>
    <p>Add an id attribute to <code>Cars</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make a collection class, with <code>addNew()</code>, <code>render()</code>,
      and <code>delete</code> functions. Use the 
      <a href="/storing-data-notes/dogs/t3.html">third dog example</a> as a 
      reference.
    </p>
    
    
    <p class="lead" id="exer4">Cars 4</p>
    <p>
      Add an interactive display of deets, like the 
      <a href="/storing-data-notes/dogs/t4.html">fourth dog example</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Change it so that the row is highlighted and the deets are shown
      when the user moves the mouse cursor over a car, without having to
      click. If s/he moves the cursor off the table, the deets go away,
      and nothing is highlighted.
    </p>

    
    <p class="lead" id="exer5">Cars 5</p>
    <p>
      Make a car editing app, like the  
      <a href="/storing-data-notes/dogs/t5.html">fifth dog example</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the line that shows the name of the car collection, show the number of 
      cars in parens after the collection name. Like 
      <code>Dream Fleet (8 cars)</code>.
